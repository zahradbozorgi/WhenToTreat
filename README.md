# Learning when to treat
 

## Instructions
The scripts that you need are the RL folder. Specifically you will need to run the following scripts:


```bash
python ppo_baseline_adapted.py
```

```bash
python ppo_temp_cost_reward.py
```

```bash
python ppo_cost_reward_mult_treat.py
```

Another file that you might need to look at is `baselineEnv.py`, which has the base class for the environment.
